# Matthew-Website
# This is my website built on React.JS
# I couldn't get the files to upload to github pages unfortunately, so to open the website you need node js to run the website in a local host
# Navigate to the file directory and type the command:npm run build
# Next run the command:npm start
# Thank You.
